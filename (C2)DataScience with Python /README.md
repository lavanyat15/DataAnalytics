# DataScience with Python

The task was to identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model one can use to better classify potential customers as being ‘at-risk’. Used machine learning regression methods in Python for this task. 
The skills practiced in this course include:

* Applying Python to Data Science problems
* Preprocessing data (e.g., Feature selection, addressing missing data, cleaning data)
* Using data mining tools and different classifiers to develop predictive models
* Using the Numpy package for scientific computing with Python
* Applying machine learning techniques to classification problems
* Using the pandas open source library for Python 
* Optimizing classifiers by adjusting and testing classifier parameters
* Using the Matplotlib Python 2D plotting library 
* Applying cross-validation methods
* Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
* Using the Sci-Kit Learn machine learning library for Python
* Comparing and selecting different predictive models
* Applying predictive models to test sets
